## 📌 Project Overview

**AccessX_Dev** is a **controlled cybersecurity engineering system** that integrates existing device analysis and reconnaissance tools into a **PHP-based web platform**.  
The system is designed strictly for **academic, ethical, and authorized demonstrations**, emphasizing **Web Engineering principles** rather than offensive security usage.

This project demonstrates how **powerful backend security tools** can be responsibly engineered into a **web-based architecture** with controlled access, auditing, and ethical safeguards.

## 🎯 Academic Focus

This project explicitly differentiates between:

- **Web Development**
  - UI design
  - Dashboards
  - Reporting interfaces

- **Web Engineering**
  - System architecture
  - Backend service integration
  - Security workflows
  - Ethical & legal constraints
  - Controlled deployment strategy
